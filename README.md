# dtlearn
this is just me implementing machine learning algorithms in python using numpy  
all implementations are in dtlearn for convenience, examples of their usage are
in tests. the implementations are written and tested in Python3 but it should
work in Python2 as long as I did not do an accidental divide by integer.

all data used for testing purposes is not mine and not yours so to distribute
